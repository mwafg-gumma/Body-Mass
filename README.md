It allows users to quickly determine their BMI by inputting their weight in kilograms and height in centimeters.

The Body Mass Index is a widely used screening tool to categorize individuals as underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese. While it's a useful indicator for most people, it should not be considered a definitive diagnostic tool for health. It serves as a general guide for understanding body composition.
